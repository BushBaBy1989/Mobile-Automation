# GK Test Mobile Automation Java

This is my submission to Global Kinetic for the role of junior tester. This is to demonstrate my knowledge of mobile automation using Java.
# For this test I used:

  - IntelliJ - To write the automation tests in Java
  - Selenium - To give us access to mobile specific api's
  - Appium - To establish a connection through to the emulated android device
  - Android Studio - To host emulated android device. Testing done using Pixel 2 settings

# Instructions to execute the tests

  - Have IntelliJ installed on the users machine, found here: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows
  - Have Android Studio installed on the users machine, found here: https://developer.android.com/studio
  - Have Appium installed on the users machine, found here: https://github.com/appium/appium-desktop/releases/tag/v1.15.1 (Select version that matches your OS type)
  - In Android Studio, open up AVD Manager.
  - If no device exists, create new virtual device (Can use Pixel 2 template) then launch virtual device
  - After device loads, drag android-ump-mobile-debug-67a35ff.apk onto andriod device to import APK and install Universal Music Player app
  - Clone or download this repository.
  - Open downloaded project in IntelliJ
  - Execute all tests 


What you should see:
  - On the android device, the Universal Music Player application should open up and autocomplete the specific test case.
  - All tests should pass

This section took me a total of 7 hours to complete.
